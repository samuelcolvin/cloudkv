key/value store based on Cloudflare workers, with a Python client.

By default the `cloudkv` Python package connects to [cloudkv.samuelcolvin.workers.dev](https://cloudkv.samuelcolvin.workers.dev) but you can deploy an instance to your own cloudflare worker if you prefer. Code for the server is in [./cf-worker](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/cloudkv/tree/main/cf-worker).

Some reasons you might use cloudkv:
* Zero DB setup or account required, just create a namespace with the CLI and get started
* Sync and async clients with almost identical APIs
* Completely open source, deploy your own cloudflare worker if you like or used the hosted one
* Pydantic integration to retrieve values as virtually and Python type
* View any value via it's URL

## Installation

```bash
uv add cloudkv
```

(or `pip install cloudkv` if you're old school)

## Usage

cloudkv stores key-value pairs in a Cloudflare worker using KV storage and D1.

To create a namespace, run

```bash
uvx cloudkv
```

Which should create a namespace and print the keys to use:

```
creating namespace...
Namespace created successfully.

cloudkv_read_key = '***'
cloudkv_write_key = '******'
```

_(You can also create a namespace programmatically, see `create_namespace` below)_

### Sync API

With a namespace created, you can connect thus:

```py
from cloudkv import SyncCloudKV

cloudkv_read_key = '***'
cloudkv_write_key = '******'
kv = SyncCloudKV(cloudkv_read_key, cloudkv_write_key)
url = kv.set('foo', 'bar')
print(url)
#> https://cloudkv.samuelcolvin.workers.dev/***/foo
print(kv.get('foo'))
#> b'bar'
print(kv.get_as('foo', str))
#> 'bar'
```

Storing structured and retrieving data:

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from cloudkv import SyncCloudKV

cloudkv_read_key = '***'
cloudkv_write_key = '******'

@dataclass
class Foo:
    bar: float
    spam: list[dict[str, tuple[int, bytes]]]

kv = SyncCloudKV(cloudkv_read_key, cloudkv_write_key)
foo = Foo(1.23, [{'spam': (1, b'eggs')}])
url = kv.set('foo', foo)
print(url)
#> https://cloudkv.samuelcolvin.workers.dev/***/foo
print(kv.get('foo'))
#> b'{"bar":1.23,"spam":[{"spam":[1,"eggs"]}]}'
print(kv.get_as('foo', Foo))
#> Foo(bar=1.23, spam=[{'spam': (1, b'eggs')}])
```

### Async API

You can also connect with the async client.

The sync and async client's have an identical API except `AsyncCloudKV` must be used as an async context manager,
while `SyncCloudKV` can optionally be used as a context manager or directly after being initialised.

```py
import asyncio
from cloudkv import AsyncCloudKV

cloudkv_read_key = '***'
cloudkv_write_key = '******'

async def main():
    async with AsyncCloudKV.create(cloudkv_read_key, cloudkv_write_key) as kv:
        await kv.set('foo', 'bar')
        print(await kv.get('foo'))
        #> bar

asyncio.run(main())
```

### API

`SyncCloudKV` has the follow methods.

_(`AsyncCloudKV` has identical methods except they're async and it must be used as an async context manager)_

```py
class SyncCloudKV:
    """Sync client for cloudkv.

    This client can be used either directly after initialization or as a context manager.
